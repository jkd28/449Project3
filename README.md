Pitt CS-0449 Project 3: A Custom Malloc
========================================
### Description:
The purpose of this program is to write a custom malloc function that uses the Best-Fit algorithm for assigning unallocated heap space.

### Results:  
The creation of memory spaces in a Linked List by the `malloc()` function was successful; however, the `free()` function introduced errors which caused a `Segmentation Fault` error.  Unfortunately, I was unable to diagnose the issue before the assignment was due.  

In an attempt to preserve my historical programming assignments and projects, I have decided not to revisit this issue.  In the future, I may create a clone of this repository and attempt to mitigate the errors I received.
